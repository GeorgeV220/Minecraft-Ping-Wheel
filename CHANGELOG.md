* Added correction period, which replaces pings sent in quick succession (adjustable between 0.1s and 5s)
* Added server-sided channel handling to forward pings only to players on the same channel (used to be client filtered)
* Converted the codebase to Java, removing the Kotlin language dependencies
* Fixed pings not clearing when switching worlds or dimensions
